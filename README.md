# uncertainty_measures
These are the Python scripts used in the article "Comparing Different Uncertainty Measures to Quantify Measurement Uncertainties in High School Science Experiments".

The file: Appendix_MC_calculation.py runs the Monte Carlo simulation that calculates the uncertainties for the different alternative uncertainty measures. The script creates three files: App-convergence.p, App-development.p, and App-deviations.p.
The three output files from Appendix_MC_calculation,py can be read and plotted by Appendix_plotting.py to create the plots used in the article.
